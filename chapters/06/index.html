    <h1>Using github</h1>
<p>Whilst <code>git</code> is a powerful and important tool to use even when working on a
project alone it becomes very powerful when working in collaboration with
others. In particular the notion of working on parallel branches extends to
different individuals working on parallel branches.</p>
<p><strong>TODO Include an image here?</strong></p>
<p>To do this, we genuinely use a <code>remote</code> version of the repository. This can be
anywhere, even a copy of the repository in another folder on your computer.
One of the most popular remote services is called <code>github</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the entire history of any copy of a <code>git</code> repository always
travels with that repository.</p>
<h2>Forking a repository</h2>
<p>The notes you are currently reading are on <code>github</code>:
<a href="https://github.com/drvinceknight/rsd">github.com/drvinceknight/rsd</a>.</p>
<p>Let us start by creating your own copy of that repository.</p>
<p>After signing in to github, click on <code>Fork</code> button.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/rsd/assets/img/forking-screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>This then creates a copy of the repository under your account.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/rsd/assets/img/copied-repo-screenshot.png" /></p>
<h2>Cloning a repository</h2>
<p>Now let us clone this repository locally: so that you will have your own copy of
it.</p>
<p>Click on <code>Clone or Download</code> and copy the https address of this repository:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/rsd/assets/img/clone-repo-screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>Exit any previous directories and open your command line and type:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git clone &lt;copied-address&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/&lt;github-username&gt;/rsd.git
Cloning into 'rsd'...
remote: Counting objects: 222, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (105/105), done.
remote: Total 222 (delta 64), reused 107 (delta 32), pack-reused 67
Receiving objects: 100% (222/222), 202.14 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (84/84), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a copy of all the source files for the course. You're welcome to
look around and see the source files. Note that you can also type <code>git log</code> to
see the entire history of how the course was written.</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>If you go to <a href="/rsd/participants/">participants list</a> you can see a list of
everyone who has participated in this course. You are now going to add yourself
to that list.</p>
<p>First branch:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git branch add-&lt;my-name&gt;-to-participant-list
git checkout add-&lt;my-name&gt;-to-participant-list
</code></pre>

<p>Now navigate to <code>src/participants/</code>. There you can see some <code>.md</code> files. Copy
one of them:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">cp vince.md &lt;my-name&gt;.md
</code></pre>

<p>Open that file with your editor and modify it to describe yourself. For more
information about markdown see <strong>TODO:
https://github.com/drvinceknight/rsd/issues/29</strong>.</p>
<p>Once that is done, let us commit that change:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git add &lt;my-name&gt;.md
git commit
</code></pre>

<p>A sensible commit message would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>Add &lt;my-name&gt; as list of participants

I took part in the course on &lt;date&gt;.

</code></pre>

<p>This change only exists on your computer. For it to make it to the main course
website, someone with control over the course website needs to be merge the
changes in.</p>
<p>So you now need to "request" that that merge happens. Github offers the
capability to do this using what is called a "Pull request" (PR)</p>
<h2>Making a Pull Request</h2>
<p>First we need to send the changes from your computer back to your remote copy.</p>
<p>Let us see what git knows about the remote:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git remote -v
</code></pre>

<p>(The <code>-v</code> is short for "verbose")</p>
<p>This gives:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">origin  git@github.com:drvinceknight/rsd.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:drvinceknight/rsd.git (push)
</code></pre>

<p>This shows that we have a single remote with short alias <code>origin</code> (note the
actual address you see might be different).</p>
<p>We want to push to that remote:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git push origin add-&lt;my-name&gt;-to-participant-list
</code></pre>

<p>After running that command and authenticating your changes will be on your own
branch:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/rsd/assets/img/open-pr-screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>Now you are ready to request that changes be merged.  To do this, click on the
"Compare and pull request" button and then write a message.</p>
<p>When opening a PR you might notice that github will attempt to use the commit
messages to enter the text in the PR message. This can be helpful but no matter
what before clicking the "Open a PR" button try to ensure that you message
follows these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include the purpose of the PR: <code>this change to the code base will...</code></li>
<li>Ask for specific feedback: <code>I attempted to do ... but would appreciate
  specific feedback on that...</code></li>
<li>Be polite and courteous: the person reviewing might be busy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you are ready to create your first pull request:
do this by clicking on "Create a pull request".</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/rsd/assets/img/create-pr-screenshot.png" /></p>
<h2>Reviewing a PR</h2>
<p>Once you have opened your PR it will be reviewed. The review might ask for some
changes:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/rsd/assets/img/review-process-screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>If that's the case, make the changes locally, on the same branch. Stage and
commit the changes. Then push them back to the same remote branch. This will
automatically update the PR.</p>
<p>Reviewing a PR (or more generally: doing a "code review") should be a helpful
and positive experience for all involved. When you have the opportunity to (you
will in the last part of this workshop) keep the following principles in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not request changes based on familiarity biais. Someone might not do
  something in the same way you have but unless there is an objective reason
  (not following a style guide, inefficiency etc...) there is no need to ask for
  such a change.</li>
<li>Do not be vague: <code>change this algorithm so that it evaluates terms based on
  number of prime factors</code> could be vague and confusing. Offer constructive and
  clear requests: including actual snippets of code.</li>
<li>When suggesting specific lines of code: make sure you have tried them
  yourself. This indeed would take time and a good code review does take time.</li>
<li>Provide context: if there is a specific reason for a request, include the
  context.</li>
<li>Be positive: use "let us change this function to do this" as opposed to "I
  don't like your function".</li>
<li>Be polite and courteous: because life is short.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is important to remember that if done well, a review of a PR should be a
conversation.</strong></p>
<h1>Tip</h1>
