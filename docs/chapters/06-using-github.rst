Collaborating with github
=========================

Objectives
----------

- Understand git remotes;
- Fork, clone and push from/to github;
- Open a PR and understand the review process.

Plan
----

- Discuss how we will now look at collaborating using git: this essentially
  corresponds to branching where different individuals use different branches.
  Github is a service that makes this easier. (Possibly mention other services:
  gitlab, bitbucket etc...).
- Demo the fork;
- Demo the clone;
- Demo modifying a file (point at extra/markdown);
- Demo the commit;
- Demo pushing: discuss that it's actually possible to have many remotes
  (`origin`/ `upstream`).
- Demo opening the PR and discuss PR message.
- Review PRs.
- Possibly discuss other useful github features such as issues, etc...
