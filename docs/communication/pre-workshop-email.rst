Pre communication email
=======================

Within 3 or 4 weeks of the course:

- Send slack invites to all participants;
- Send the following email to all participants (some generic terms such as 
  <DATES>)::

    Dear all,

    You are receiving this email because you have indicated your intent to
    attend the "Research Software Development" workshop on <DATES>.

    Here are a couple of things you need to do before the workshop starts:

    1. You have been sent an invitation to a "Slack" room: please accept it
       which will mean you join the messaging service we will be using.
    2. You will be using your own laptop during the workshop. If you do not have
       a laptop please let us know and we will sort that out.
    3. For those of you that have a laptop, please install the software listed
       here: https://vknight.org/rsd/extras/software/.
    4. On <DATES> you are invited to <ROOM> where we will check that all the
       software has been installed correctly.

    We look forward to the workshop!

    Thank you,
    <NAMES OF TUTORS>
