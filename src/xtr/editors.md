# Editors

There are many editors that can be used to write software. Some of these are
more on the lightweight side of the spectrum: for example
[Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) and others are more feature rich such as
[CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) which can be language specific.

Choosing an editor can take a long process of experimenting with many different
ones.

## Nano

Nano is a lightweight editor available on most systems. For a lot of people it
is a default editor for their `git` setup and opens when writing a commit
message:

- `CTRL + O`: saves a file.
- `CTRL + X`: closes Nano

## Vim

Vim is another lightweight editor that often is only used as a default `git`
editor:

- `Esc + wq + Enter`: saves and quits vim

Vim can also be a fully fledged editing environment for many languages and has a
rich ecosystem of plugins.

## Sublime

Sublime is a popular editor amongst users of Python but it is also very
suitable to most languages with a rich ecosystem of plugins.

Note that it is free to use but after an initial period of time, it will suggest
making a financial contribution to its development.

## Atom

Atom is an editor built by Github. It is fully open source and fully
customizable. It again has a rich ecosystem of plugins and is appropriate for
many languages.

## VS Code

VS Code is another editor similar to Atom and Sublime. It is developed by
Microsoft and open source.

It has many plugins and is a appropriate for many languages.

## CLion

[www.jetbrains.com/clion/](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)

CLion is an example of what is called an Integrated Development Environment
(IDE). This implies that it is a bit more feature rich than a text editor. CLion
is specifically for C. It can be used to write code for other languages but that
is not it's purpose.

## PyCharm

[www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

PyCharm is similar to CLion in that it is a full IDE but it is aimed at python.
