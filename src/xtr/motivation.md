# Motivation

In a recent study by the sustainable software institute it was found that 7 out
of 10 UK researchers would not be able to carry out their research without
software:

This is certainly applicable in mathematics:

- Numerical mathematics makes use of software to implement algorithms;
- Pure mathematics often makes use of software to identify and/or verify
  conjectures;
- All fields of mathematics use software to communicate the work.

When software is used it can be done in such a way that is not easily repeatable
and verifiable. For example, a recent study identified an alarming number of
errors in genetic research (20%) due to the use of Excel:

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce best practice so as
to ensure this won't occur.

Here are a number of sources that provide excellent guidance and references on
these issues:

(NB if you were to write a paper about some research software you have written
these would make good references.)
